RA	 H Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
Wed like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park
d to the Hall of Champions presentation
H We have four geldings and one stallion that well present for you this afternoon
H and as we bring them out
well give you the history on each one
and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want
and to ask questions

Our first horse here today at the Hall of Champions
is our only thoroughbred stallion
This is Bold Forbes
H Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion
and he was foaled in nineteen seventythree
H He is by the stallion Irish Castle
and out of the unraced mare Comely Nell
H He was bred by Lee Eaton
and Red Bull Stables
H This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventyfour
H Mister Estaban Tizol
a banker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico
H liked Bold Forbes pedigree
And he liked this horse so much
H that he decided he was going to buy him
no matter what the cost
H The cost ended up being fifteenthousand twohundred dollars
H and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico
H In Bold Forbes very first start in Puerto Rico as a twoyearold
H he went off at odds of thirtyfive to one
and he won that race by seventeen lengths
H He was entered into four more races
he won them all
H and in doing so
he was named champion twoyearold in Puerto Rico
H Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico
H so it didnt take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition
H So in the summer of nineteen seventyfive
he was shipped to New York
to his new trainer Laz Barrera
H In New York he won the Freemont Stakes
and the Saratoga Special
before he injured his shins
and was given the rest of the year off
H Well all of Bold Forbess races up to this point had been sprints
or six furlong races
H The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race
at a mile and a quarter
So as a threeyearold
Forbes wasnt given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby
H But his trainer had more confidence in him than that
H and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle
H Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby
at odds of seventeen to one
one length in front of the leader
Honest Pleasure
H The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes
He cut his left hind heel during the race
but he still managed to run third
H But when the Belmont rolled around
he had that all healed up
and he won the Belmont stakes by a neck
H In October
Forbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap
and again he severely bruised his right hind foot
H Again he ran a very game third
but after this race
he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury
H So he was retired to stud from the track
H Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share
H and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm
H As a stallion
Bold Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass
a winner of over half a million dollars
H Bold Apparel
a champion filly in Italy
H Air Forbes One
and over twohundred other winners
H  Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars
in just two years on the racetrack
H He was in eighteen races
and had thirteen wins
and was never worse than third
H He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninetyone
H He is twentyone years old
and stands fifteen point three hands tall
H Ladies and gentlemen
the nineteen seventysix Kentucky Derby winner
Bold Forbes
MANY	 APPLAUSE
DEBRA	 Does anyone have any questions
while were waiting for the next horse to come out
Questions
Okay
while were waiting
Ill just call everyones attention to this horse
I dont know if everyone can see him
H over here in this paddock on the right
H this is Sergeant Pepper Feature
and
hes usually in our show
but
because Bold Forbes is up here today
he
We kicked him out
We have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions
H and only five stalls
So we could only have five at a time in the show
H Um
Sergeant Pepper was the nineteen eightytwo world champion racing quarter horse
H and
at the time of his retirement
he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history
H and he had earnings of over ninehundred thousand dollars
So
on your way out  today
you might wanna just take a look over there
and say hi to Sergeant Pepper

And theres Bold Forbes looking out the window
If anybody can see him
hes right there
H watching the show

H Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions
that is not a racehorse
This is Imperator
And he is a fivegaited American Saddlebred showhorse
H Perry
as he is commonly called
is by the sire Supreme Sultan
who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park
H He is out of the dam Empress Wing
and she is by the great sire Wing Commander
H Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator
H Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois
H and he was purchased there as a twoyearold
by his owner
Doctor Geraldine Meanor
H and then sent to his trainer
Don Harris
of Simpsonville Kentucky
H Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared
H They both had the same birthday
H And as the years went past
and Imperators popularity increased
H Mister Harris didnt get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did
H Being fivegaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits
the walk trot and canter
H plus two manmade gaits
the slow gait and the rack
H The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which theyre performed
Perrys greatest accomplishment was winning the fivegaited world grand championship four times
H And he has also been reserve world champion five times
H He was shown eightyfive times
at fortyfour shows around the country
H He has sixtyeight blue ribbons
thirteen seconds
and very rarely was he ever worse than third
H Now the first time Perry was shown
he was very wild and inexperienced
and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring
H And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions
H But the second time he was shown
he had improved so much
H the judges said he would have won if hed been lying on his back
with all four feet stuck up in the air
H Perrys most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail
H At the highlight of his career
H  Perrys tail was fourteen feet long
and could be wrapped completely around his body
If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry
H you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail
H When Perry was retired
Mister Harris cut his tail
to make it easier to care for
H and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perrys tail
H Well Perry had been retired here for about two years
H but had never had a formal retirement
H So in August of nineteen ninetyone
Perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky
H That night
Imperator and his trainer
Mister Don Harris
H stepped into the ring
one last time together
H and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteeneighties
H Perry is now twenty years old
and stands fifteen point three hands tall
H Ladies and gentlemen
the fourtime world grand champion
Imperator
MANY	 APPLAUSE
DEBRA	 Does anyone have any questions
while were
Yes
AUD	 Whats the average age that a horse lives to
DEBRA	H A good average is about twentyeight
if theyre well taken care of
Um
a lotta horses will live into their thirties
H A a good way to compare horse ages to humans
is to multiply by three
And
Except
I think the oldest liv
Oh
oldest horse on record
I think in the Guinness Book of World Records
was sixtytwo
So dont multiply that  that one by three
That would be what
H a hundred and eightysix  X or something X H
Are there any other questions
No
If anyones interested in seeing what Perry looked like
when he had his fourteenfoot tail
H um
when you come into the visitor center
I dont know if if  anybody noticed this
H theres a TV monitor right after you
Where you buy your tickets when you come in
and you look up
and theres a
H An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there
H and uh
theres a little clip of Imperator on there
and I think hes slowgaiting
which was his most  beautiful gait
H um
and you can see his fourteenfoot tail up there
and that was
It was really beautiful
SNIFF
Do you have a question
Back there
AUD	 He wants to know how you say hi to a horse
DEBRA	 Um
just say hi
You can just say hi
and they
And you can say their name
cause they know their names
So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator
just
And he goes by Perry
so if you just come up to him and say VOX hi Perry VOX
hell know youre talking to him
H Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions
this is Forego
H Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli
and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda
He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky
H Due to Foregos large size
he was not raced as a twoyearold
H because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature
H He started his racing career as a threeyearold
And he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventythree Kentucky Derby
H Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby
H on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown
H Well Forego wasnt as successful as Secretariat that day
H But he did run a fine race
H He was involved in a bumping incident
as the horses left the starting gate
H He recovered from that
but he and another horse
Our Native
H bumped through the entire stretch
and both horses ended in a photo finish for third
After the stewards inquiry
H Forego had to settle for fourth
because the steward said the bumping was all his fault
H The older Forego got
the better he got
and he became one of the greatest handicap horses to ever race
H He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century
H Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha
Forego had to carry a lot of extra weight
H over whatever distance he was asked to run
H in order to give the other horses more of a chance
H He was in thirtyfour handicap events
and thirty times
he was the highweighted horse
H The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory
was a hundred and thirtyseven pounds
H And that was in the nineteen seventysix Marlboro Cup
H Well before the race it had rained
and the track was sloppy
H and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet
So as the field turned for home
it looked just as if he was hopelessly beaten
some ten lengths behind the leader Honest Pleasure
H Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year
He was three years younger than Forego
H and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight
But determined to win
H Forego made up that last quarter mile
in twentytwo seconds flat
H and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire
The jockey that rode Forego
the great Willy Shoemaker
H said there wasnt a horse alive
that couldve beaten Forego on that day
H Forego was named horse of the year
three consecutive years
in nineteen seventyfour seventyfive and seventysix
H And he has also been champion sprinter
as well as champion handicap horse
H An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive
H And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards
which is more than any other horse
Forego retired in nineteen seventyeight
H with earnings of over one point nine million dollars
which made him the second richest thoroughbred in history at that time
behind Kelso
H He was inducted into racings hall of fame in nineteen seventynine
H Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions
H he is twentyfour years old
and stands a very impressive H seventeen point one hands tall
Ladies and gentlemen
the great handicap horse
Forego
MANY	 APPLAUSE
DEBRA	 Does anyone have any questions
Questions

X Okay X
H Oh
Okay
H I dont have my glasses on
I couldnt see you H
AUD	What is the average weight for a horse
DEBRA	 Um it varies
um
like  probably
TSK lets see
Forego probably weighs around t
oh about twelve hundred
maybe twelve fifty
H some of the draft horses weigh over a ton
in the draft horse barn
some of the
The Belgians are the biggest horses
The the Shires are the tallest
but the Belgians are the heaviest
And
Have you been to the draft barn yet
Did you see Roy and Captain
SM the two big Belgians SM
They weigh
they both weigh over two th
I th
I know  Roy does
Im not sure about Captain
but Roy weighs over two thousand pounds
Yes
AUD	 Isnt Secretariat
didnt he die
and wasnt he buried on X this property somewhere X
DEBRA	Uh
uh hes buried at Claiborne Farm
AUD	Claiborne
DEBRA	Mhm
AUD	 How did he die
DEBRA	 Pardon
AUD	 How did he die
DEBRA	 He was put down
he had laminitis
which is a disease of the h
Of the hoof
and and they put him down
H Our next horse to come out today
is our other thoroughbred gelding to be retired here
H and youll see that hes a lot smaller than Forego
This is John Henry
H John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings
H He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers
who was not much of a racehorse or a stallion either
H And he is out of the brood mare Once Double
H who outside of John Henry
had very little success as a brood mare
H John was born on March ninth nineteen seventyfive
at Golden Chance Farm in Paris Kentucky
H The farm kept John until nineteen seventysix
when he was consigned to the Keenenland January Mixed Sale
H Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse
H its usually when people try to sell the horses they dont think are worth feeding through the winter
H So because of his small size
his lack of pedigree
but most of all
his very nasty disposition
H John brought only eleven hundred dollars
H And from the time of this first sale
until May nineteen seventyeight
H John was sold
over half a dozen times
because nobody wanted him
H and nobody could get along with him
H But in May of nineteen seventyeight
a New York businessman
Sam Rubin
H decided it would be fun to own a racehorse
H Well Mister Rubin didnt know anything about horses
H and the only thing he knew about racing
is where the valet parking was
H So he bought John Henry
over the telephone
sight unseen
for twentyfive thousand dollars
H John then went to New York
to his first trainer Bobby Donato
H In his very first New York start
he won a twentyfive thousand dollar claiming race
over the dirt
by one and a half lengths
H His next race was on turf
H which John preferred to run on
and again he won
but this time by fourteen lengths
H Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did
H advised him to send John west
where the turf racing was more lucrative
more competitive
and run all year long
So in late nineteen seventynine
H John headed west
to his new trainer
Ronald McAnally
H In nineteen eighty
John won over ninehundred thousand dollars
H In nineteen eightyone
John won the very first Arlington Million
H over one point seven million dollars
and was voted horse of the year
H In nineteen eightytwo
and nineteen eightythree
John had some injuries
and only won four races
H but they mounted up to one point two million dollars
H And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nineyearold
H folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age
H Well John did lose his first race that year
H but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack
H He won six graded stakes
including a repeat victory in the Arlington Million
H over two point three million dollars
and again was voted horse of the year
H When John was retired in nineteen eightyfour
he was the worlds richest thoroughbred in history
H With earnings over six point five million dollars
H Since then Alisheba has beat his record
but John is still the richest gelding
H John holds seven Eclipse Awards
which is second only to Foregos eight
H and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety
John was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade
for the nineteen eighties
H John has been retired here for eight years now
H He is nineteen years old
and stands a very small
H fifteen point one hands tall
H Ladies and gentlemen
the great great  John Henry
MANY	 APPLAUSE
DEBRA	 Does anyone have any questions
Yes
AUD	 The horses that retire here
how much exercise
and what kind of XX XXX
DEBRA	Okay
These horses are  are not ridden anymore
um
theyre just
l like you said
theyre retired
H they each have their own paddock
except for Sergeant Pepper and Imperator
they
We turn them out together
because theyre friends
H and mostly they just hang out in their paddock
and they graze and
H they exercise themselves
they run around a lot
and keep themselves in shape
and
H thats about all they do
They get
H they get lots of treats
and lots of love and
s we think theyre happy
But
H they still run around
um
just  like young horses
sometimes John will get out there and run around
hell rear up on his hind legs
like  Silver
you know and do
H And uh its real cute
uh Foregoll run around
H Willie
and his little goat will get out there and
H and run and
Imperator usually likes to trot
He doesnt gallop a lot
but he trots around like he did when he was showing and
H its
Theyre real cute
There any other questions
AUD	 Yes
What
Uh
the goat  in with the horse
Are they just  good friends
DEBRA	Uhuh
Thats his little buddy
Theyre just friends
H He
Willie doesnt really like other horses very well
H And and he likes people
but hes not as affectionate as maybe Perry
or  Sergeant Pepper so
H we dont want him to get lonely
and thats his
thats his little friend

Originally they had got the goat for John Henry
when he first came to live here
eight years ago
H and they put the goat in the stall with him
he kicked it back out
H  and um
H  so Willie adopted it

And that  original goat died about a year ago
and Willie was real sad and depressed
so they got him a new one
H Our last horse to come out today
is our standardbred representative
Rambling Willie
H A standardbred races at a trot or a pace
and they pull a sulky with a driver
H Willie is a pacer
H Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana
and he began his racing career as a toyearold
for his owner Raymond Gibson
H He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds
H so he did show some promise
but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a threeyearold
H Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver
Mister Robert Farrington
for fifteen thousand dollars
H But not long after he bought him
Mister Farrington decided hed spent too much money on this horse
H so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio
Mister Paul Sebert
H and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie
H Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before
H and his luck had been pretty bad
H The first horse he owned died
before it made it to the racetrack
H and the second horse he owned made it to the races
and she ran and ran
but just couldnt win anything
so he sold her
H And after he sold her
she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner
H Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though
H and things didnt start off so well there either
Willie was being raced at county fairs
in Ohio and Indiana
H and was being beaten on a regular basis
H Well around this time Mister Farringtons wife Vivian was having a birthday
H and he was trying to decide what to get her
H So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian
would be the other half of Willie
H Well Vivian was a very religious person
H and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church
H So Vivian decided
that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack
H she would donate ten percent
of her half of Willies earnings
to her fathers church
H And thats when Willies racing career took off
MANY	LAUGHTER
DEBRA	H Because of his success
and his ties to the church
there was a book written about Willie
titled
H Rambling Willie
The Horse That God Loved
H In order to promote his book
Willie would hold autograph sessions
H One day when Willie was in New York
he had an autograph session at Macys department store
H And he was such a hit there
that Macys gave him his very own charge card
MANY	LAUGHTER
DEBRA	H Well Willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race
H He raced from the age of two to thirteen
He had an incredible threehundred and five starts
H He won a hundred and twentyeight times
H sixtynine times he finished second
and seventynine times he paced the mile
in two minutes or less
H which is a record Willie still holds today
When he retired
he was the richest standardbred in history
H with earnings over two million dollars
H Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions
H he is twentyfour years old
and stands fifteen point two hands tall
H Ladies and gentlemen
the horse that God loved
Rambling Willie
MANY	APPLAUSE
DEBRA	 Now Ill just let everybody know
that Willies book is for sale here at the Horse Park gift shop
H And wed like to thank everyone
for coming to the Horse Park
and to the Hall of Champions presentation
H we hope youve had a good day
and if you have any questions
feel free to ask us on your way out
Thank you very much
MANY	 APPLAUSE
